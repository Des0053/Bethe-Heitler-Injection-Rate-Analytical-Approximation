# Bethe-Heitler-Injection-Rate-Analytical-Approximation
Python class-script providing an analytical approximation of the pair distribution produced due to Bethe-Heitler pair production.

Function Q_inj describes the produced electron/positron distribution as a function of the electron/positron Lorentz factor, $\gamma_e$, for the interaction of a single proton of Lorentz factor $\gamma_p$
interacting with a single photon of energy $\epsilon$ (in $m_e c^2$ units). 

The modelling and properties of the function are desrcibed in the paper "A closer look at the electromagnetic signatures of Bethe-Heitler pair production process in blazars" by D. Karavola and M. Petropoulou (to be submitted).
